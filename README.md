# Project "Healthy Life"

![Devices picture](assets/images/all-devices.png)

This page has been created for the needs of my first milestone project as a Full Stack software developer student of the Code Institute.

This is a website that aims to promote healthy eating style.

## UX

This website is addressed to people of all ages who want to change their eating habits for a healthier one. The right nutrition plan for an individual, prepared especially for you. An appropriate calorie requirement plan created for a specific person.

## Wireframes

Wireframe shows how the webpage will look on three different devices(Desktop,Ipad and Mobile). Wireframes were designed with [Balsamiq Wireframes 4.0.28](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/).

### Tools Used

## Testing

The project was tested on development tools in Google Chrome and the responsiveness of mobile devices was also tested.

The first of the testing steps was on W3C Markup Validation and W3C CSS validation.

The second of testing steps was http://ami.responsivedesign.is/, which has been used to see how the site performs on different devices and their viewports. All pages, links, icons performed as expected on all devices. I also used it to create the all-devices.png at the top of this Readme.

The third step was testing by the Slack community, my mentor from the Code Institute and my friends and family.

Testing consists of finding any errors that could reveal the incorrect operation of the website during its use. The website was also tested on mobile devices.

All problems related to the functioning of the site have been resolved.
